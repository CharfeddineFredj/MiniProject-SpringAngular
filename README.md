# 🌟 Administrative Management System

## 🚀 Project Description  
The **Administrative Management System** was developed during my professional internship at **ITGUST**. This system allows for the efficient management of users and administrative data. Administrators can manage user details, roles, and administrative records with ease. The system was built using **Angular** for the frontend, **Spring Boot** for the backend, and **MySQL** for data storage.

## 🎯 Main Features

### 🧑‍💻 **User Management**  
- Add, update, and remove user information.  
- View user details and manage user roles.

### 🛠️ **Administrative Data Management**  
- Manage various administrative data such as policies, reports, and records.  
- Maintain and update records in a user-friendly interface.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

### Frontend  
- 🎨 **Angular** – For dynamic and responsive web applications.  
- 💻 **TypeScript** – For type-safe and scalable frontend code.

### Backend  
- ⚙️ **Spring Boot** – Framework for building backend services.  
- 🗄️ **MySQL** – For managing the administrative data and user information.

### Architecture  
- **Monolithic** architecture for simplicity and efficient development.

## 📋 Methodology  
The project followed a **Scrum** methodology, ensuring that each phase of development (planning, design, development, and testing) was completed iteratively and incrementally, allowing for continuous feedback and improvements.
